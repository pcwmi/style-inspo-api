I'm experiencing an SSL error when accessing my Vercel-deployed site (styleinspo.vercel.app) from the Arc mobile browser on iOS. The error message is: "An SSL error has occurred and a secure connection to the server cannot be made."

However, the site works perfectly in:
- Safari mobile (same device)
- Chrome mobile (same device)
- All desktop browsers
- All other mobile browsers tested

This indicates the issue is Arc browser-specific, not a problem with my SSL configuration.

TECHNICAL VERIFICATION:
I've verified my SSL configuration is correct:
1. SSL Labs Test: A+ rating on both servers (216.198.79.195 and 64.29.17.195)
   Test URL: https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=styleinspo.vercel.app

2. Certificate Chain: Complete and valid
   - Verified via openssl s_client - all intermediate certificates present
   - Certificate chain: *.vercel.app → WR1 → GTS Root R1 → GlobalSign Root CA
   - OCSP stapling: Enabled and working
   - TLS version: 1.3

3. Vercel SSL Settings: Verified in dashboard - domain properly configured, no SSL warnings

TROUBLESHOOTING COMPLETED:
1. ✅ Redeployed the project multiple times (to refresh certificate chain)
2. ✅ Verified SSL settings in Vercel dashboard
3. ✅ Tested SSL certificate via SSL Labs (A+ rating)
4. ✅ Updated Arc browser to latest version
5. ✅ Tested on different networks (WiFi and cellular data - same error on both)
6. ✅ Cleared Arc browser cache and data
7. ✅ Verified it works in Safari on the same device (confirms Arc-specific issue)

KNOWN ISSUE REFERENCE:
I found a Vercel Community discussion about this exact issue:
https://community.vercel.com/t/sites-deployed-to-vercel-app-not-reachable-via-arc-browser-latest-on-ios-26-2-iphone-15/30524

This appears to be a known compatibility issue between Arc mobile browser (iOS) and Vercel's .vercel.app domains.

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS:
Based on my investigation, Arc mobile browser has stricter SSL validation than other browsers. However, my certificate chain is complete, OCSP stapling is enabled, and SSL Labs confirms everything is configured correctly. The issue appears to be Arc's validation of Vercel's certificate chain specifically.

REQUEST:
Could you please:
1. Confirm if this is a known issue with Arc browser and .vercel.app domains
2. Check if there's a Vercel-side fix (e.g., certificate chain configuration, edge server SSL settings)
3. Provide guidance on whether using a custom domain would resolve this
4. Update the community thread if there's a resolution or workaround

ADDITIONAL INFO:
- Device: iPhone
- Network Tested: Both WiFi and cellular data (same error on both)
- Other Browsers Tested: Safari ✅, Chrome ✅ (both work on same device)
- Project: styleinspo
- Account: pcwmi's projects (Hobby plan)
