      "styling_notes": "Partially tuck the cream blouse into the high-waisted pants to emphasize the waist. Drape the scarf softly around the neck without tying to keep it light and airy. The gold earrings add a touch of elegance and should be the focal point, so keep other jewelry minimal.",
      "why_it_works": "This outfit is perfect for an outdoor afternoon wedding due to its light, breathable fabrics like cotton and lightweight textures. The wide-leg pants offer a relaxed yet classic silhouette, while the pumps add elegance and formality, in line with wedding attire. The playful element comes through the scarf's floral pattern and the tie-front blouse, aligning with the user's aspirational relaxed style by keeping the look airy and comfortable."
