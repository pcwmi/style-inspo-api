- Wedding: "White embroidered cowboy boots - Breaks: Conventional choice of heels"
- Work: "Turquoise graphic tee - Breaks: Mixing graphic tee with polished pants"
- Casual: "Leopard Print Scarf - Breaks: Adding bold print to classic outfit"

### Format Variations

### Model Behavior
The chain-of-thought prompt successfully:
- Shifts model toward explicit compositional reasoning
- Forces articulation of "unexpected element" choices
- Requires justification for why contrasts work together
- Ensures style DNA coverage verification

**Primary Issue:** Output format (text + JSON) incompatible with current JSON parser. Model is following instructions perfectly, but parser expects pure JSON.
