2025-09-27 22:02:58 - today we fix the bug of rendering and get the data structure to a more scalable state. even though it feels like no visible progress but i feel now we're at a place we can build on the algo for 'how to' tab. i think i'm a bit stuck because I don't yet have a 'what great looks like' for styling the challenging items. but tmrw let's make sure that i first provide a) what great looks like without building the algo - the eval part b) build the algo and compare against my what great looks like. i want your help to make sure I focus on a) first and help me think about how I can do eval more systematically.
