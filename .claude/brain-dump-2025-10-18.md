(2) Immediate desire to save outfits emerged - users want to remember these combinations. (3) Now building features based on my own user feedback - feels like true product iteration, not just feature building. This is the product development loop\!

This pre-execution validation loop dramatically improves first-try success rate - like giving feedback on someone's plan before they start work. Prevention beats debugging.
2025-10-19 07:50:51 - Product direction shift: E2E is working, time to focus on UX and user value delivery. Key questions to explore: (1) Mobile web vs native mobile app - what's the right delivery format? (2) Use cases to prioritize: how-to styling tutorials, trend integration, occasion/daily-based outfit selection. (3) Enhanced visualization: more photo/video of person wearing outfits to manifest the styling vision. Moving from tech validation to user experience optimization.
