I need you to implement a new "Closet-First Upload UX" feature for my Next.js app (style-inspo).

This feature addresses the #1 user frustration from activated users: clunky photo upload flow and inability to manage wardrobe items.

Full specification: /Users/peichin/Projects/style-inspo-api/.claude/SPEC-closet-first-ux.md

Key changes:
1. Create new /closet page (main wardrobe view with category tabs, item grid, floating "+ Add" button)
2. Convert upload to modal (not separate page)
3. Add photo guidelines modal (first-time users only)
4. Create item detail/edit page (tap item to view/edit metadata)
5. Add delete confirmation modal
6. Update dashboard navigation (Manage Closet → /closet instead of /upload)

Critical requirements:
- Mobile-first design (320px-428px width)
- Client-side EXIF auto-rotation (fix Android sideways photos)
- Client-side image compression before upload
- Live upload status ("Analyzing X photos...")
- No auto-redirect after upload (bug fix)

Repo structure:
- Frontend: /Users/peichin/Projects/style-inspo-api/frontend (Next.js 13+)
- Backend: /Users/peichin/Projects/style-inspo-api/backend (FastAPI)

Please read the full spec and let me know if you need any clarification before starting.
