# Style Inspo: Product Vision

*This document captures the evolving product vision as we build from 0 to 1. Updates track how our understanding of the problem and solution develops over time.*

## Current Vision (v1.0) - Personal Styling Assistant

**Target User**: Initially building for myself - someone who loves fashion but struggles with daily styling decisions and wants to maximize their existing wardrobe.

**Core Philosophy**: "Whatever outfit we generate still needs to feel like me" - All styling must be grounded in understanding the user's innate style and comfort zone.

## Three Core Use Cases

### 1. "How Item" Styling
**Problem**: "I have items I really like but don't wear enough because they feel 'too much' or 'too dressy'"
- Example items: cowboy boots, special dresses, statement pieces
- Current behavior: These items sit unworn because they feel hard to style casually
- Desired outcome: Get daily inspiration for incorporating beloved-but-underused pieces

**User Story**: "Hey, I'm waking up and I want to wear my cowboy boots today. How do I style them so they feel like me and not like a costume?"

### 2. Mood-Based Styling
**Problem**: "I want to dress for how I want to feel today, connected to my personal style"
- Daily emotional goals: relaxed, fun, tender, confident, professional, creative
- Constraints: Weather, personal style DNA, available wardrobe
- Current behavior: Default to safe choices that don't match desired mood

**User Story**: "Today I want to feel confident and a bit playful. It's 72°F and sunny. What can I wear from my closet that honors my soft, elegant style but pushes me toward that playful energy?"

### 3. Inspiration Translation
**Problem**: "I see fashion inspiration (Instagram, runway, street style) but don't want to buy everything new"
- Inspiration sources: Phoebe Philo collections, Instagram influencers, Pinterest mood boards
- Desired outcome: Create "homage" looks using existing wardrobe
- Value: Creativity and sustainability over consumption

**User Story**: "I'm inspired by this Phoebe Philo collection aesthetic. What can I create from my closet that captures this mood without buying anything new?"

## Underlying Technical Requirements

- Identify aspirational direction (style growth goals)
- Track daily emotional preferences and patterns

**Styling Intelligence**:

## Future Evolution Potential

- Add more sophisticated mood and occasion detection

**Long-term (6-12 months)**:
