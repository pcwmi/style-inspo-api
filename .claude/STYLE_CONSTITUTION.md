# Style Constitution: Core Principles of Good Style

*The foundational principles that define what makes an outfit truly great, serving as the philosophical foundation for Style Inspo's evaluation framework.*

## Principle 1: Style DNA Alignment

A great outfit reflects the person's style DNA across all elements of the outfit.

**Core Concept**: If someone's style is "soft, elegant, and playful," a great outfit incorporates elements of ALL three characteristics throughout the look.

**Example**:
- **Soft**: White t-shirt with drapy, relaxed shoulders
- **Elegant**: Classic bootcut jeans with refined silhouette
- **Playful**: Bold patterned scarf with novelty twist


## Principle 2: Intentional Contrast

A great outfit contains thoughtful contrast that creates visual interest and prevents monotony.

**Key Insight**: Contrast extends far beyond superficial elements like "black vs. white" or "long vs. short." It encompasses multiple dimensions of styling.

### 2a. Proportional Contrast
- **Less clothes, bigger accessories**: In summer heat, minimal clothing (tank top, shorts) paired with chunky sneakers or oversized bag
- **Volume play**: Fitted top with voluminous bottom, or vice versa

### 2b. Wrong Shoe Theory
Breaking expected footwear conventions to add unexpected contrast:
- Sneakers with dress instead of expected heels
- Dress shoes with casual jeans instead of expected sneakers
- Combat boots with feminine dress instead of expected delicate shoes

### 2c. Textural Contrast
Mixing different textures even within similar color palettes:
- Black tweed blazer + soft black t-shirt + light grey jeans
- Smooth leather + chunky knit + crisp cotton
- Structured denim + flowing silk + matte metal accessories

### 2d. Expectation Contrast (Surprising Elements)
- **Statement + Statement**: Instead of toning down around a statement piece, adding another statement piece to create intentional bold balance
- **Context Subversion**: Wearing formal pieces in casual settings or casual pieces in elevated contexts
- **Style Mixing**: Combining aesthetics that don't typically go together (preppy + grunge, western + elegant)

*Note: All contrast must still honor Principle 1 (Style DNA Alignment)*

## Principle 3: Intentional Details

A great outfit shows thoughtful attention to styling details that demonstrate care and intention.

**Philosophy**: The difference between "thrown together" and "thoughtfully styled" lies in purposeful details.

### 3a. Layering Details
- White t-shirt showing beneath grey crewneck sweater
- Collared shirt peeking out from under pullover
- Strategic color reveals through layering

### 3b. Repetitive Elements
- Layered accessories (multiple necklaces, stacked rings)
- Repeated colors or textures across different pieces
- Intentional redundancy that creates visual rhythm

### 3c. Styling Gestures
- Cuffed sleeves on blazers or jackets
- Draped belts rather than tightly cinched
- Partially tucked shirts
- Rolled pants cuffs
- Artfully undone elements (unbuttoned top button, loose scarf draping)

**The Intentionality Test**: Does this detail look like it happened on purpose, or by accident?

## Application to Evaluation Framework

These principles provide the foundation for evaluating outfit quality beyond simple metadata matching:

1. **Style DNA Alignment** → Assess whether outfit elements support the user's three-word style profile
2. **Intentional Contrast** → Reward outfits that create thoughtful tension and visual interest
3. **Intentional Details** → Recognize styling sophistication and purposeful choices

*This constitution serves as the philosophical backbone for Style Inspo's "How To" styling suggestions and evaluation criteria.*
