# Brain Dump: 2025-11-14 - Review Fatigue & Leverage Points

## The Bottleneck Realization

**Review fatigue is real** - now most of my job is to review output - very similar to my old job as a manager/manager of managers. I review Claude's output, I review Cursor's output. I context switch which can be tiring.

**The biggest rate limiting factor for my throughput is now MY time.**

Because as soon as I can complete the convo with Claude on what I want to build, I pass it to Cursor, Cursor builds it in like 10-15 mins. And sometimes I feel I have diff AI tools' output 'waiting' for me to review where I'm the bottleneck of the production line.

**This is a sign of me needing to reinvent how I work so I can gain more leverage.**

## What's Working

I think by having Claude write the whole spec (a long but Cursor-friendly spec) definitely has decreased the back and forth needed I had to do with Cursor.

So the **prescriptive spec approach is working** - less iteration with Cursor.

## Where Can I Further Increase Leverage?

The limitation/clunkiness of the UX has been weighing on me. So maybe another aspect to leverage more agent help?

### Potential Leverage Points to Explore:

1. **Agent reviews agent output?** Can Claude review Cursor's implementation before I look at it?
2. **Batch review mode?** Instead of reviewing incrementally, let both agents work, then review in one batch?
3. **UX/design agent?** The UX clunkiness issue - can an agent help with design iteration?
4. **Automated testing?** Reduce manual testing burden?
5. **Work mode optimization?** Time-box agent interactions, batch context switching?

### The Manager Parallel

This IS like being a manager of managers:
- Claude = Senior IC (spec writer)
- Cursor = Senior IC (implementer)
- Me = Manager reviewing work, making strategic decisions

But unlike managing humans, agents work FASTER than I can review. That's the new problem.

### Questions to Explore

- How do I shift from "reviewing everything" to "spot-checking + strategic direction"?
- Can agents review each other's work with my criteria?
- What parts of the review process can be delegated vs must be me?
- Is UX design the next bottleneck after implementation speed?

**Meta insight**: This is exactly the kind of problem I wanted to have - being limited by my own throughput, not the tools. Now the question is: how do I scale myself?
