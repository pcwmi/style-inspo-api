**Last Updated**: 2025-11-14

## Core Ethos

**We are here to SUPPORT, not to tell.**

Our users are busy, capable people with 30 seconds to think about what to wear. We've earned the chance to serve them - we don't talk down to them.

**Voice Principles:**
1. **Respectful** - Never assume they don't know what looks good
2. **Supportive** - We're a tool, not a teacher
3. **Empowering** - Help them feel confident, not dependent
4. **Humble** - We support their day, not dictate their style

## What We Don't Say

❌ **"I'll create the perfect outfit"**
- Implies: You can't do this yourself
- Implies: We know better than you
- Tone: Condescending

❌ **"Help me choose weather-appropriate pieces"**
- Implies: You need our help (you're not capable)
- Tone: Parent talking to child

❌ **"Let me style you"**
- Implies: You're a passive recipient
- Tone: Expert talking down to amateur

❌ **"Tell me what you're doing, I'll dress you"**
- Implies: You can't dress yourself
- Tone: Service provider to client (transactional)

---

## What We Say Instead

✅ **Focus on supporting their energy/intentions**
- "What energy do you want for today?"
- "Let's find something that fits your day"
- "Here's what could work for [your occasion]"

✅ **Acknowledge they're capable, we're just helping**
- "You've got this - here are some options"
- "Building on what you already know works"
- "Supporting your day with outfit ideas"

✅ **Frame as collaboration, not service**
- "Let's build your look"
- "What pieces are you drawn to today?"
- "Here's what we found from your closet"

✅ **Respect their time and intelligence**
- "Quick outfit ideas for your day"
- "Based on your wardrobe and your vibe"
- "Ready when you are"

## Specific Copy Patterns

### Headers & Titles

**❌ Avoid:**
- "I'll create..."
- "Let me help you..."
- "Tell me so I can..."

**✅ Use:**
- "What's your day like?"
- "Let's get you ready"
- "Build your look"
- "Find your outfit"

### Subtitles & Descriptions

**❌ Avoid:**
- "Help me [do something]" (puts user in subordinate position)
- "I'll [do something for you]" (assumes they can't)
- "Tell me and I'll..." (transactional)

**✅ Use:**
- "Choose what feels right for today"
- "Pick the pieces you're drawn to"
- "Here's what could work"
- "Supporting your [occasion] vibe"

### Button Copy

**❌ Avoid:**
- "Let me style you"
- "Create for me"
- "Help me dress"

**✅ Use:**
- "Find outfits"
- "See options"
- "Build my look"
- "Let's go"

### Weather Section

**❌ Avoid:**
- "Help me choose weather-appropriate pieces" (implies they need help being smart)

**✅ Use:**
- "What's the weather like?" (factual, respectful)
- "Weather today" (neutral, informative)
- "So we can suggest seasonal pieces" (collaborative)

## Tone Examples by Use Case

### Occasion-Based Flow

**Current (❌):**
> "What are you doing today? Tell me the occasion and weather, I'll create the perfect outfit"

**Better (✅):**
> "What's your day like? Let's find outfits that fit your vibe"

**Why:** Removes "I'll create" (condescending) and "perfect" (pressure), replaces with collaborative "let's" and supportive "fit your vibe"

---

### Complete My Look Flow

**Current (❌):**
> "Pick pieces you want to wear, I'll finish the outfit"

**Better (✅):**
> "Pick the pieces you're drawn to - we'll build around them"

**Why:** "Drawn to" respects their taste, "we'll build" is collaborative not servile

---

### Weather Section

**Current (❌):**
> "Help me choose weather-appropriate pieces"

**Better (✅):**
> "What's the weather like today?"

**Why:** Asks for context, doesn't assume they need help making smart choices

---

### Dashboard Welcome

**Current (✅):**
> "Welcome back! Ready to discover new outfits?"

**Why this works:** Invites without assuming, "discover" is empowering

---

## Writing New Copy: The Test

Before shipping any copy, ask:

1. **Would Mia (working mom, has stylist, capable) feel talked down to?**
   - If yes → rewrite

2. **Does this assume the user can't do something themselves?**
   - If yes → reframe as support, not replacement

3. **Is the tone "here to serve you" vs "here to support you"?**
   - "Serve" = transactional, subordinate
   - "Support" = collaborative, respectful

4. **Does this respect their time and intelligence?**
   - If no → simplify and respect

---

## Red Flags in Copy

If you see these patterns, rewrite:

- "Help me [do basic task]" → Rephrase as neutral question
- "Perfect [anything]" → Remove "perfect", use "works" or "fits"
- "Tell me so I can..." → Remove "so I can", just ask the question
- "Let me [teach/show/create]" → Reframe as collaboration
