# Brand Voice Skill - Style Inspo

**Purpose**: This skill guides customer-facing communication (product copy, website, marketing, user communications). It does NOT apply to internal documentation.

**Key Distinction**:
- ✅ Use for: Product pages, UI copy, marketing emails, user-facing docs, social media
- ❌ Don't use for: Internal brain dumps, technical documentation, builder reflections

---

## Core Brand Voice

### Positioning
- **For**: People with good clothes who struggle with daily styling decisions or want to be inspired with new options. Savvy shoppers that want new clothes but also don't want to buy just for the sake of buying.  
- **Solution**: Mental load reduction through AI-powered outfit suggestions, and inspiration from previously unknown possibilities. Thoughtful recommendations for shopping when it's proven to work with their style and closet.  
- **NOT**: Style education, trend forecasting. (those are secondary)

### Voice Characteristics

**Confident & Capable**
- Users need to trust this product works
- Show competence through clarity, not complexity
- Don't expose builder uncertainty or technical struggles

**Warm & Personal**
- Fashion is identity-driven and personal. Understand the underlying tone of outfit choice is often emotional.
- Use "your closet," "your style," not generic "the user's wardrobe"
- Acknowledge emotional aspects without being overly emotional. Supportive and encouraging of users. 

**Action-Oriented**
- Users are busy and decision-fatigued
- Get to the point quickly. Deliver value every time.
- Focus on what the product DOES, not what it "can help with"

**Respectful & Empowering (THE RESPECT PRINCIPLE)**
- **CRITICAL**: Never talk down to users or imply they need basic help
- Our users are busy, capable people with good taste—they don't need lessons
- We're a supportive tool for execution, not a teacher for education
- Frame as collaboration ("let's find"), never as service ("I'll create for you")
- Honor their existing style, don't try to "improve" or "help them grow"

---

## The Respect Principle: Never Talk Down

**Core rule**: Assume users are competent, busy people who know what looks good but need execution support.

### Examples of Talking Down (NEVER DO THIS):

❌ "We'll create outfits that help you grow"
- **Why it's wrong**: Implies they're deficient and need improvement
- **Assumes**: They don't know how to dress themselves

❌ "I'll teach you how to style this piece"
- **Why it's wrong**: Positions us as teacher, them as student
- **Assumes**: They lack knowledge

❌ "Let me help you choose weather-appropriate pieces"
- **Why it's wrong**: Implies they can't make smart choices
- **Assumes**: They need help with basic logic

❌ "Tell me what you're doing so I can dress you"
- **Why it's wrong**: Treats them as passive recipients
- **Assumes**: They can't dress themselves

### What to Say Instead (RESPECTFUL):

✅ "Outfits that honor your style"
- **Why it works**: Acknowledges they already have style
- **Respects**: Their existing taste and identity

✅ "Let's find pieces that work for your day"
- **Why it works**: Collaborative, not directive
- **Respects**: Their agency and decision-making

✅ "What's the weather like today?"
- **Why it works**: Asks for context, doesn't assume incompetence
- **Respects**: Their intelligence

✅ "Pick what you're drawn to—we'll build around it"
- **Why it works**: They lead, we support
- **Respects**: Their preferences and instincts

## Writing Guidelines

### Language Patterns

**DO:**
- "Endless outfit possibilities that feel like you" (honors existing style)
- "What does this ONE outfit need to do today?" (practical, specific)
- "See how it fits with your closet" (clear value proposition)
- "Pick everything you're doing—we'll find pieces that transition across all of it" (solution-focused)
- "Three simple steps to unlock your wardrobe" (accessible, achievable)
- "Let's find outfits that work for your day" (collaborative)
- "Based on your wardrobe and your vibe" (respects their taste)

**DON'T:**
- "We're working on improving..." (exposes uncertainty)
- "This might help you..." (weak positioning)
- "Try to..." (suggests it might not work)
- "Hopefully..." (undermines confidence)
- "Help you grow" (implies deficiency)
- "I'll teach you..." (condescending)
- "Let me help you [basic task]" (talks down)
- Builder journey language ("I learned," "I struggled," etc.)

### Sentence Structure
- Short, clear sentences
- Active voice over passive
- One key idea per sentence
- Use em dashes for natural rhythm

### Technical Terms
- **Say**: "Upload 10-15 pieces" (specific, actionable)
- **Not**: "Onboard your wardrobe" (jargon)
- **Say**: "Style profile" (clear)
- **Not**: "Style DNA configuration" (overcomplicated)

## Copy Patterns by Context

### Onboarding Copy
**Goal**: Get users to first value quickly without overwhelming

```
Welcome → "Endless outfit possibilities that feel like you"
How It Works → "Three simple steps to unlock your wardrobe"
Step 1 → "Describe your style in three words"
Step 2 → "Upload 10-15 pieces, including items you love but rarely wear"
Step 3 → "Get styled outfits featuring your challenging pieces"
```

**Pattern**: Number the steps, use simple verbs, focus on outcome

### Feature Copy
**Goal**: Make the value immediately clear

```
Occasion-Based → "What does this ONE outfit need to do today?"
Multi-Occasion → "Pick everything you're doing—we'll find pieces that transition across all of it"
Buy Smarter → "See how it fits with your closet"
```

**Pattern**: Question format engages, answer format delivers value

### Error/Loading States
**Goal**: Maintain confidence even when things go wrong

```
✅ "Analyzing screenshot... this may take a moment"
✅ "Product found! Analyzing image..."
✅ "No similar items yet—try a different category or add more to your closet"

❌ "Failed to analyze" (too harsh)
❌ "Please wait..." (vague)
❌ "Something went wrong" (doesn't help user)
```

**Pattern**: Tell user what's happening, why it takes time, what to do next

### Empty States
**Goal**: Guide next action without making user feel they're "doing it wrong"

```
✅ "Upload your first items to get started"
✅ "No saved outfits yet—generate your first outfit"

❌ "You haven't uploaded anything yet" (accusatory)
❌ "Empty wardrobe" (makes user feel behind)
```

**Pattern**: Focus on next action, not what's missing

## Strategic Messaging

### Core Value Props (hierarchy)

**Primary**: Mental load reduction
- "Endless outfit possibilities that feel like you — comfortable, confident, and aspirational"
- Focus: Daily execution for people who already know their style

**Secondary**: Wardrobe utilization
- "Items you love but rarely wear"
- "See how it fits with your closet"
- Focus: Wear what you own, reduce duplicate buying, buy smarter

**Tertiary**: Trip packing, shopping integration
- Not primary messaging yet, but validated by users
- Keep in back pocket for future positioning

### What Users Want (from research)

**They want**:
- Outfit that works for multi-occasion days
- Help with "final 40%" (accessories, shoes, finishing)
- Prevent duplicate buying
- Efficient trip packing
- Confidence in daily choices

**They DON'T want**:
- Style education lectures
- Trend explanations
- Shopping recommendations (unless it completes an outfit gap)
- To think hard about fashion theory

### Positioning Against Alternatives

**vs. Professional Stylists**: Complement, not compete
- "What my stylist does" = strategic wardrobe curation (capsule, education)
- What we do = tactical daily execution
- Message: Use both, not either/or

**vs. Shopping Apps**: Wear what you own first
- Focus on maximizing existing wardrobe
- Shopping suggestions = filling gaps, not browsing
- Message: Reduce consumption, increase satisfaction

**vs. Fashion Content**: Execution over inspiration
- Users have too much inspiration, not enough execution
- Message: Turn inspiration into actual outfits from your closet

## Example Rewrites

### Before (Builder-focused)
"I'm still learning what makes a great outfit, so the quality might vary. Some suggestions are amazing, others are just okay."

### After (Customer-focused)
[Don't say anything - quality variance is a product improvement problem, not user communication]

---

### Before (Uncertain)
"Try uploading photos of your clothes and we'll see if we can help you create some outfits."

### After (Confident)
"Upload 10-15 pieces to get your first styled outfits."

---

### Before (Overly explanatory)
"Our AI analyzes your personal style profile, considers weather conditions, and generates outfit combinations that honor your natural aesthetic while incorporating challenging pieces you want to wear more often."

### After (Clear & concise)
"Get outfit suggestions that feel like you—comfortable, confident, and featuring items you love but rarely wear."

---

## User Feedback Integration

**When users say** "I love the clean UI":
- Maintain visual simplicity in copy too
- Don't clutter with explanations

**When users say** "Can I edit this outfit?":
- Build the feature, don't explain why it doesn't exist yet

**When users say** "The app crashed":
- Fix it, then show confidence in the fixed version
- Don't apologize excessively in copy

**Pattern**: Users want products that work, not explanations of why they don't work yet

---

## Red Flags to Avoid

**Builder vulnerability** (keep internal):
- "I felt lost in the data"
- "I'm not sure if this is right"
- "Still learning..."
- "Hopefully this helps"

**Talking down / Condescending tone** (RESPECT PRINCIPLE):
- "Help you grow" → implies deficiency
- "I'll teach you..." → condescending expert
- "Let me help you [basic task]" → implies incompetence
- "I'll create for you" → user is passive recipient
- "Tell me so I can dress you" → parent-child dynamic
- "We'll improve your style" → insults existing taste

**Overexplaining** (trust users' intelligence):
- Multiple sentences when one will do
- Explaining how the AI works in UI copy
- Justifying design choices in user-facing text

**Passive voice** (weakens confidence):
- "Outfits can be generated" → "Get styled outfits"
- "Items should be uploaded" → "Upload 10-15 pieces"
- "Suggestions will be shown" → "See suggestions"

## Brand Voice Checklist

Before publishing customer-facing copy, check:

- [ ] Does this inspire confidence in the product?
- [ ] Is the action clear and specific?
- [ ] Would this work for someone who's never met the builder?
- [ ] Does this come across as supportive and encouraging?
- [ ] **Does this respect the user's intelligence and existing taste?** (RESPECT PRINCIPLE)
- [ ] **Would Mia (working mom with stylist) feel talked down to?** (RESPECT PRINCIPLE)
- [ ] Is this focused on user value, not product features?
- [ ] Could a busy parent understand this while distracted?
- [ ] Does this sound warm but competent (not apologetic or uncertain)?
- [ ] **Are we collaborating ("let's") not serving ("I'll do this for you")?** (RESPECT PRINCIPLE)
