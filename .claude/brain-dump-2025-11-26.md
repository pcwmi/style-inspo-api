## $(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') - Mixed feelings on progress and direction

**Excitement:**
- Buy smarter feature progress feels good

**Technical concerns:**
- Image extraction from URL is more nuanced than expected (e.g., URL for pants but first photo shows model wearing tshirt + pants - which piece to extract?)
- Need to figure out how to identify the RIGHT piece from product pages

**Eval system fatigue:**
- Eval feels mentally exhausting
- Unsure how to turn eval results into actionable improvements
- Not clear on the feedback loop from metrics → code changes

**Cost milestone reached:**
- Crossed first $10 OpenAI budget (small but symbolic)
- Setting mental milestone: if costs exceed $200, will reassess
- Makes me think about project sustainability

**Strategic uncertainty:**
- Feeling lost about monetization path (or if I even want to pursue that)
- Passionate about creating best outfit quality, but unclear HOW to actually make that happen
- Tension between:
  - Core quality (outfit generation)
  - UX polish (typical app things)
  - Business model thinking
- All three feel important but pulling in different directions

**Underlying question:** What should I focus on when there are so many valid priorities?
